The proposed project under UCR is titled “109MW Large Scale Bundle Nepal Hydroelectric Station by Nabil
Bank Limited., here in after refer as “HYDRONABIL” It is a bundle of hydropower projects located in Nepal.
The proposed project activity involves TWO HYDROELECTRIC PROJECTS located in different regions of
Nepal. 

The details are as follows:

1. 27MW Dordi Khola Hydropower Project - (PROJECT -1): A Run-of-River (RoR) type hydroelectric project
with a generating capacity of 27 MW. The project is being developed by Himalayan Power Partner Ltd.
(HPPL), Kathmandu, Nepal. The entire project area lies in Chiti, Dhodeni, and Bansar VDCs in the
Lamjung district, western Nepal. It is connected to Kathmandu by a 170 km road.

2. 86MW Solu Khola (Dudhkoshi) Hydroelectric Project (SKDKHEP) (PROJECT -2): Also a Run-of-River
(RoR) type hydroelectric project with a generating capacity of 86 MW. The project is being developed by
Sahas Urja Ltd., Kathmandu, Nepal. It is located in Solududhkunda Municipality & Thulung Dudh Koshi
Gaupalika (formerly Tingla, Kangel, and Panchan VDCs) of Solukhumbu District, Sagarmatha Zone,
Nepal. The project area is about 130 km east of Kathmandu (aerial distance).
This project is an ongoing operational activity aimed at continuous reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions and is currently being applied under the “Universal Carbon Registry” (UCR).

Purpose of the project activity:

Nepal currently faces challenges in undertaking voluntary carbon projects in the power sector, primarily
because its national electricity grid is already dominated by low-emission renewable sources, particularly
hydropower. As a result, implementing additional renewable energy projects within the country yields
limited incremental emission reductions, making them ineligible for carbon credit generation under typical
baseline methodologies. However, by exporting clean electricity to neighbouring countries with more
carbon-intensive grids, Nepal can enable measurable emission reductions beyond its borders and benefit
from mechanisms such as the Universal Carbon Registry (UCR) credits program. The project involves the
development and operation of two hydroelectric power plants, using advanced turbine technologies to
efficiently convert the natural river flow into clean electricity without contributing to greenhouse gas
emissions.

The first component of the project is the Dordi Khola Hydropower Project, which utilizes Horizontal axis
Francis- type turbines, each with a capacity of 9.3 MW, resulting in a total installed capacity of 27 MW.
Developed by Himalayan Power Partner Ltd. (HPPL), this project leverages the natural flow of rivers in the
Lamjung district to generate renewable electricity. The power generated will be transmitted to several
states in India, all part of the Northern, Eastern, Western, and North-Eastern (NEWNE) Electricity Grid,
thereby supporting India's growing demand for clean energy and aligning with regional goals to reduce
dependence on fossil fuels.

Similarly, the Solu Khola (Dudhkoshi) Hydroelectric Project incorporates Vertical Axis Pelton turbines, each
with a capacity of 30.32 MW, providing a total installed capacity of 86 MW, including a 10% continuous
overload (COL) capacity. Developed by Sahas Urja Ltd., this project will also supply renewable energy to
multiple states in India connected to the NEWNE Electricity Grid. By utilizing these renewable energy
resources, both projects significantly reduce carbon emissions and enhance regional energy security,
supporting the transition to a more sustainable energy infrastructure for both Nepal and its neighbouring
countries.

The document (Annexure : Documentation of Nepal–India Grid Power Export Arrangement ) does detail the Table 1: Power Distribution and Project Details
____________
Sr.No State Allocation (in MW) %to the installed capacity
____________
1 Haryana 109.61 Not specified

Details:
 State: Haryana (the allocation is directed only to Haryana Discoms)

 Approved Allocation: 109.61MW (comprising 83.42MW from Solu Khola (Dudhkoshi) Hydropower
Project and 26.19MW from Dordi Khola Hydropower Project; other proposed projects were not
approved in this document)
____________________
PROJECT 1: Dordi Khola Hydropower Project
For the Dordi Khola Hydropower Project (27MW), the available official wet commissioning/loss rejection
tests for all three units were witnessed by NEA and company representatives and completed on the same
date:

Turbine Unit Commissioning (Load Rejection Test) Date
____________
Unit I 10/09/2022

Unit II 10/09/2022

Unit III 10/09/2022

This indicates the turbines were commissioned (at least wet-testing and load rejection) on 10th September
2022, which fits with industry practice for such documentation.

PROJECT 2: Solu Khola (Dudhkoshi) Hydropower Project
There are three generating units in this project, each with an individual commission (synchronization) date
as per the official commissioning test reports:
_________
Turbine Unit Commissioning (Synchronization) Date
_______________
Unit 1 10/02/2023

Unit 2 11/02/2023

Unit 3 12/02/2023

All three units underwent their synchronization tests in February 2023, which is the official commissioning
activity before commercial operation begins. The approved power import transactions from Nepal to Haryana Discoms, through NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam
Limited (NVVN), for specific hydropower projects.
